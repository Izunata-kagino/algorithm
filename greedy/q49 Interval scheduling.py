Question 49.  Interval scheduling
Suppose you are given a list of lectures with their start time and end times. How can you choose
the maximum number of non-overlapping lectures?
This problem is also sometimes articulated as the party planning problem:
You are asked to be the organizer for n parties and are provided with their
start and end times. (For example: P1: 7 AM â€“ 9 AM; P2: 8 AM to 3 PM;
P3: 4 AM to 8 AM.)You can only be organizing one party at a time, so you
need to choose. For every party that you organize, you are given a fixed
reward (1000$) irrespective of the length of the party. How do you select the
parties to maximize your reward ? What is the time complexity of your
algorithm in terms of n?
